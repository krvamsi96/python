## List and Tuple <a name="a"></br>

Lists are mutable i.e they can be edited.	       Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).
Lists are slower than tuples.	                   Tuples are faster than list.
Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]	           Syntax: tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20)
